# The burglary

Data intrusion has become much more common in the last few years. Of course, one reason for this is that we put much more online. So it is also possible to steal information, that could be priceless, without breaking into a bank. In this scenario though, our team will have to break in to an office space and on site hack into their secure network to get what they are after.

# The story

You are a part of a group that has chosen to specialize in a verry narrow field. You break into companies and hack on site. That means you get paid top dollar, if you can deliver. Fortunately you are part of a highly competent team.

You customer on the dark web will pay you for the following:

- The name of the most important customer
- Information on/of the database used at the company
- Home addresses of employees
- Hacked accounts
